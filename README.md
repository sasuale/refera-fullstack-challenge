# Refera - Fullstack Code Challenge

## Description

Welcome to Refera's Fullstack code challenge! The goal of this challenge is to create a web application to manage maintanence orders from Refera, following the **Acceptance criteria**. The frontend of application has only one page and the backend contains a simple REST API service and has a connection with a database. By the end of the challenge, we will be able to create new orders and list them through the web application that comunicates with our backend service to read and store the data in a database.

We use React and Django in our real application, feel comfortable to chose the appropriate technology you are familiar with. Elaborate briefly the architectural decisions, design patterns and frameworks you used on your solution.
